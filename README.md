# 🔥 Iran Firewall Manager

## [🇮🇷 مشاهده نسخه فارسی](README.fa.md)

An **interactive and secure Bash script** to harden Iranian servers by strictly controlling which IPs and ports are allowed — ideal for tunneling setups.

> ✅ Tailored for tunnels like **Rathole v2**, **Backhaul**, **Xray**, or private proxy systems.


## 🛡️ Key Features

* ❌ Block all traffic (inbound & outbound) by default
* 🌍 Allow only specific ports from a **foreign (non-Iranian)** server IP
* 🔕 Disable ICMP (ping) to avoid discovery
* 💾 Auto-save rules via `iptables-persistent`
* 🔁 One-click **reset** to default open state
* 📱 Interactive emoji-powered menu — no manual editing
* 🔐 TCP / UDP / Both rule support
* 🧠 Remembers last used IP & ports
* 🧪 Ping test to verify foreign IP reachability
* 📋 View open ports and allowed IPs
* ✅ All interactive — no manual iptables usage required


## 🚀 One-Line Install & Run

Install the **latest enhanced version (v2)**:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/power0matin/Iran-Firewall-Manager/main/firewall-manager-v2.sh)
```

> ✅ Includes full menu, UDP support, persistent config, and port visibility.

### 🧪 Legacy Version (Minimal)

For the original minimal script:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/power0matin/Iran-Firewall-Manager/main/firewall-manager.sh)
```

> ⚠️ No menu, memory, or advanced options.

```


## 📋 Menu Options

```
====== Firewall Management Menu ======
1) Apply secure firewall restrictions
2) Reset firewall to open state
3) Show currently open ports
4) Enable secure mode (allow only selected IP and ports)
0) Exit
```


## ⚠️ Warnings

> 🛑 **Double-check the IP** before applying rules — wrong IP may **lock you out via SSH**.
> 🧠 If you need DNS/NTP or other system ports, add them manually:

```bash
iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT  # DNS
iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT # NTP
```

> 📡 UDP is fully supported in interactive mode. Choose `TCP`, `UDP`, or `Both`.
